# Voice Technology 2021/2022: Master Thesis by Marjolein Spijkerman

This GitHub page contains an overview of all the code that I used for the experiments. 

## The source of the base code and the data set

As base for the experiments, I used already existing for the MaskCycleGAN-VC. This can be found on [https://github.com/GANtastic3/MaskCycleGAN-VC](https://github.com/GANtastic3/MaskCycleGAN-VC).

The data that I used can be found on [http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/UASpeech/](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/UASpeech/). To access this data you first need to ask for permission, this is why I cannot share the data on this GitHub page. 

## Changes I made to the code
